Powershell Cookbook
===================

Installs and configures PowerShell 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 or 5.0.

For users of Chef 10 without the `powershell_script` built-in resource, this cookbook also includes a resource/provider for executing scripts using the PowerShell interpreter.

Requirements
------------

### Platforms

Not every version of Windows supports every version of Powershell. The following table illustrates Powershell support across the Windows family. **Included** means that the base installation of the operating system includes the indicated version of Powershell.

### Cookbooks

* windows

PowerShell also requires the appropriate version of the Microsoft .NET Framework to be installed, if the operating system does not ship with that version. The following community cookbooks are used to install the correct version of the .NET Framework:

* ms_dotnet2
* ms_dotnet4
* ms_dotnet45

Resource/Provider
-----------------

**Note**: In Chef 11, use the built-in [powershell_script](http://docs.opscode.com/resource_powershell_script.html) resource.

### `powershell`

Execute a script using the PowerShell interpreter (much like the script resources for bash, csh, perl, python and ruby). A temporary file is created and executed like other script resources, rather than run inline. By their nature, Script resources are not idempotent, as they are completely up to the user's imagination. Use the `not_if` or `only_if` meta parameters to guard the resource for idempotence.

#### Actions

- :run: run the script

#### Attribute Parameters

- `command`: name attribute. Name of the command to execute.
- `code`: quoted string of code to execute.
- `creates`: a file this command creates - if the file exists, the command will not be run.
- `cwd`: current working directory to run the command from.
- `flags`: command line flags to pass to the interpreter when invoking.
- `environment`: A hash of environment variables to set before running this command.
- `user`: A user name or user ID that we should change to before running this command.
- `group`: A group name or group ID that we should change to before running this command.
- `returns`: The return value of the command (may be an array of accepted values). This resource raises an exception if the return value(s) do not match.
- `timeout`: How many seconds to let the command run before timing it out.

#### Examples

```ruby
# change the computer's hostname
powershell "rename hostname" do
  code <<-EOH
  $computer_name = Get-Content env:computername
  $new_name = 'test-hostname'
  $sysInfo = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem
  $sysInfo.Rename($new_name)
  EOH
end
```

```ruby
# write out to an interpolated path
powershell "write-to-interpolated-path" do
  code <<-EOH
  $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/powershell-test.txt"
  $stream.WriteLine("In #{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}...word.")
  $stream.close()
  EOH
end
```

```ruby
# use the change working directory attribute
powershell "cwd-then-write" do
  cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
  code <<-EOH
  $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "C:/powershell-test2.txt"
  $pwd = pwd
  $stream.WriteLine("This is the contents of: $pwd")
  $dirs = dir
  foreach ($dir in $dirs) {
    $stream.WriteLine($dir.fullname)
  }
  $stream.close()
  EOH
end
```

```ruby
# cwd to a winodws env variable
powershell "cwd-to-win-env-var" do
  cwd ENV['TEMP']
  code <<-EOH
  $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "./temp-write-from-chef.txt"
  $stream.WriteLine("chef on windows rox yo!")
  $stream.close()
  EOH
end
```

```ruby
# pass an env var to script
powershell "read-env-var" do
  cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
  environment ({'foo' => 'BAZ'})
  code <<-EOH
  $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter] "./test-read-env-var.txt"
  $stream.WriteLine("FOO is $env:foo")
  $stream.close()
  EOH
end
```

Mixin
-----

The `Chef::Mixin::PowershellOut` mixin has been moved to the [windows](http://ckbk.it/windows) cookbook.

Usage
-----

**Note**: The installation may require a restart of the node being configured before PowerShell can be used.

### default

The default recipe does nothing.

### powershell2

Include the `powershell2` recipe in a run list, to ensure PowerShell 2.0 is installed.

On the following versions of Windows the PowerShell 2.0 package will be downloaded from Microsoft and installed:

- Windows XP
- Windows Server 2003
- Windows Server 2008
- Windows Vista

On the following versions of Windows, PowerShell 2.0 is present and must just be enabled:

- Windows 7
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2008 R2 Core

### powershell3

Include the `powershell3` recipe in a run list, to install PowerShell 3.0 is installed on applicable platforms. If a platform is not supported or if it already includes PowerShell 3.0, an exception will be raised.

### powershell4

Include the `powershell4` recipe in a run list, to install PowerShell 4.0 is installed on applicable platforms. If a platform is not supported or if it already includes PowerShell 4.0, an exception will be raised.

### powershell5

Note: Windows Management Framework 5 is in preview.

Include the `powershell5` recipe in a run list, to install PowerShell 5.0 is installed on applicable platforms. If a platform is not supported or if it already includes PowerShell 5.0, an exception will be raised.
